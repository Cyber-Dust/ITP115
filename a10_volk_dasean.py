# ------------------------------------WELCOME TO THE MUSIC LIBRARY GENERATOR----------------------------------------- #

# The program uses a .dat file with a list of albums by Adele, the Beatles, and The Who. First, a display menu appears
# which allows you to choose to display the library or the artists, add an album/artist to the library, delete an
# album or delete an artist. Lastly, the program allows you to generate a random playlist. Once g is chosen for
# exit, the program saves your altered library to a new file (make sure to put .dat at the end of your new file name).
# Boom: You have curated, mangled and generated a file of musicians and their albums, all using python dictionaries.
