# Files

* A file is a collection of information
* Stored as text (.py, .html, .css) or binary ([Word Doc] .docx, [Images] .jpg, .png, [Music] .mp3)

#### OPEN A FILE
* Use open()

`
file_obj = open(filename, mode)

fileIn = open("words.txt", "r")
`
* "r" = read or file access mode
* "words" = file name
* ".txt" = file type

 2 parameters to the function:
* **File Name** is a string variable for the name of the file
* **Mode** is a string variable for the file access mode

Function returns: file_obj
* a **file object variable** (new variable type)

#### **CLOSE** A FILE
* Use close()

`
file_obj.close()
`

Take any data and saves it into CSV (Comma Seperated Values)

line = line.strip()
